# EzRental

**Description:** <br>
The current market for accommodation rental is fragmented and inefficient. There are many different websites and apps that list rooms for rent, but it can be difficult and time-consuming for users to find the right place. Additionally, landlords often have to pay multiple fees to list their rooms on different platforms. This proposed application named as EzRental will address the problem of fragmentation and inefficiency in the accommodation rental market by providing a single platform for landlords and tenants to connect. The application will be easy to use and will offer a wide range of features that will help users to find the perfect place to stay. EzRental application will be implemented using a cloud-based architecture. This will ensure that the application is scalable and can handle a large number of users.
